### Notes

* For some unknown reason, the ale package was delisted from CRAN. I'm positive that I never received any notification for any issues.
* Perhaps it has to do with the delisting of the ALEPlot package which the ale package suggests.
* So, this bug fix version pushes in-development new features and bug fixes as a patch release.
* All issues from R CMD resolved (locally, rhub::rhub_check(), and win-builder.r-project.org)
