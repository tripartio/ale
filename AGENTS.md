## Repository overview

**ale** — Interpretable Machine Learning and Statistical Inference with Accumulated Local Effects (ALE)

Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) were initially developed as a model-agnostic approach for global explanations of the results of black-box machine learning algorithms. ALE has a key advantage over other approaches like partial dependency plots (PDP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP): its values represent a clean functional decomposition of the model. As such, ALE values are not affected by the presence or absence of interactions among variables in a mode. Moreover, its computation is relatively rapid. This package reimplements the algorithms for calculating ALE data and develops highly interpretable visualizations for plotting these ALE values. It also extends the original ALE concept to add bootstrap-based confidence intervals and ALE-based statistics that can be used for statistical inference. For more details, see Okoli, Chitu. 2023. “Statistical Inference Using Machine Learning and Classical Techniques Based on Accumulated Local Effects (ALE).” arXiv. <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2310.09877>.

## Standard workflow

For any feature, fix, or refactor:

1. **Update packages**: `pak::pak()`
2. **Run tests** — confirm passing before changes: `devtools::test(reporter = "check")`. If any fail, stop and ask.
3. **Plan** — identify affected R files; check if new exports are needed.
4. **Test first** — write failing test, then implement: `devtools::test(filter = "name", reporter = "check")`.
5. **Implement** — minimal code to pass tests.
6. **Refactor** — clean up, keep tests green.
7. **Document** — document any new or changed exports.
8. **Verify**: Run `devtools::test(reporter = "check")`, then `devtools::check(error_on = "warning")`. Resolve warnings, errors, and NOTEs.
9. **News** — add bullet at top of `NEWS.md` (under dev heading):
   - User-facing changes only. 1 line, end with `.`
   - Present tense, positive framing, function names (backticks + `()`) near start: `` * `fn()` now accepts ... `` not `* Fixed ...`
   - Issue/contributor before final period: `` * `fn()` now accepts ... (@user, #N). `` where `#N` is the GitHub issue number being implemented (e.g. `#42`).
   - Get username: `gh api user --jq .login`; get issue number from the user's prompt, the branch name (`git branch --show-current`), or `gh issue list`.
   - **Never guess or invent an issue number.** Before writing it, verify: (1) you received it from the user or the branch name, OR (2) you looked it up with `gh`. If you cannot trace the number to a concrete source, use `#noissue`.

## General

- R console: use `--quiet --vanilla`.
- Always run `air format .` after generating R code.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*.
