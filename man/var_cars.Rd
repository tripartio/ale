\description{
This is a transformation of the \code{mtcars} dataset from R to produce a small dataset with each of the fundamental datatypes: logical, factor, ordered, integer, double, and character. Most of the transformations are obvious, but a few are noteworthy:
\itemize{
\item The row names (the car model) are saved as a character vector.
\item For the unordered factor, the country of the car manufacturer is obtained based on the row names (model).
\item For the ordered factor, gears 3, 4, and 5 are encoded as 'three', 'four', and 'five', respectively. The text labels make it explicit that the variable is ordinal, yet the number names make the order crystal clear.
}

Here is the adaptation of the original description of the \code{mtcars} dataset:

The data was extracted from the 1974 \emph{Motor Trend} US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973--74 models).

Henderson and Velleman (1981) comment in a footnote to Table 1: 'Hocking (original transcriber)'s noncrucial coding of the Mazda's rotary engine as a straight six-cylinder engine and the Porsche's flat engine as a V engine, as well as the inclusion of the diesel Mercedes 240D, have been retained to enable direct comparisons to be made with previous analyses.'
