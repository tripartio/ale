#' @title Multi-variable transformation of the mtcars dataset.
#'
#' @description
#' This is a transformation of the `mtcars` dataset from R to produce a small dataset with each of the fundamental datatypes: logical, factor, ordered, integer, double, and character. Most of the transformations are obvious, but a few are noteworthy:
#'
#' * The row names (the car model) are saved as a character vector.
#' * For the unordered factor, the country of the car manufacturer is obtained based on the row names (model).
#' * For the ordered factor, gears 3, 4, and 5 are encoded as 'three', 'four', and 'five', respectively. The text labels make it explicit that the variable is ordinal, yet the number names make the order crystal clear.
#'
#' Here is the adaptation of the original description of the `mtcars` dataset:
#'
#' The data was extracted from the 1974 *Motor Trend* US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973--74 models).
#'
#' @format
#' A tibble with 32 observations on 13 variables.
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{model}{\code{character}: Car model}
#'   \item{mpg}{\code{double}: Miles/(US) gallon}
#'   \item{cyl}{\code{integer}: Number of cylinders}
#'   \item{disp}{\code{double}: Displacement (cu.in.)}
#'   \item{hp}{\code{double}: Gross horsepower}
#'   \item{drat}{\code{double}: Rear axle ratio}
#'   \item{wt}{\code{double}: Weight (1000 lbs)}
#'   \item{qsec}{\code{double}: 1/4 mile time}
#'   \item{vs}{\code{logical}: Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)}
#'   \item{am}{\code{logical}: Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)}
#'   \item{gear}{\code{ordered}: Number of forward gears}
#'   \item{carb}{\code{integer}: Number of carburetors}
#'   \item{country}{\code{factor}: Country of car manufacturer}
#' }

#' @note
#' Henderson and Velleman (1981) comment in a footnote to Table 1: 'Hocking (original transcriber)'s noncrucial coding of the Mazda's rotary engine as a straight six-cylinder engine and the Porsche's flat engine as a V engine, as well as the inclusion of the diesel Mercedes 240D, have been retained to enable direct comparisons to be made with previous analyses.'
