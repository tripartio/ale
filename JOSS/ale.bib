  abstract = {Public bike-sharing programs have been deployed in hundreds of cities worldwide, improving mobility in a socially equitable and environmentally sustainable way. However, the quality of the service is drastically affected by imbalances in the distribution of bicycles among stations. We address this problem in two stages. First, we estimate the unsatisfied demand (lack of free lockers or lack of bicycles) at each station for a given time period in the future and for each possible number of bicycles at the beginning of the period. In a second stage, we use these estimates to guide our redistribution algorithms. Computational results using real data from the bike-sharing system in Palma de Mallorca (Spain) are reported. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In many supervised learning applications, understanding and visualizing the effects of the predictor variables on the predicted response is of paramount importance. A shortcoming of black box supervised learning models (e.g. complex trees, neural networks, boosted trees, random forests, nearest neighbours, local kernel-weighted methods and support vector regression) in this regard is their lack of interpretability or transparency. Partial dependence plots, which are the most popular approach for visualizing the effects of the predictors with black box supervised learning models, can produce erroneous results if the predictors are strongly correlated, because they require extrapolation of the response at predictor values that are far outside the multivariate envelope of the training data. As an alternative to partial dependence plots, we present a new visualization approach that we term accumulated local effects plots, which do not require this unreliable extrapolation with correlated predictors. Moreover, accumulated local effects plots are far less computationally expensive than partial dependence plots. We also provide an R package ALEPlot as supplementary material to implement our proposed method.},

  abstract = {Bicycle-metro integration, in which bicycling is used as a flexible feeder mode to connect with public transport nodes presents new opportunities for sustainable transportation. It is known that the built environment can influence travel attitudes and choice, yet the empirical evidence for the role of built environment features in shaping the bicycle-metro integration remains rare. Inspired by the idea of text mining, this article is an attempt to demonstrate a data-driven semantic framework to capture key topic-based features of land use and bicycle-metro integrated usage in the vicinity of metro stations as well as their interactions. Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling is analogously implemented here to generate a range of probability-based land use patterns and mobility patterns, and the associations between them are investigated by multivariate linear regression. A case study from Shanghai shows that the mixed land use and diversification of urban functions in the catchment areas of the metro stations can be detected effectively by 11 identified land use patterns. Based on 7 derived mobility patterns, this paper gives a probabilistic explanation to the time-varying properties of the bicycle-metro usage. All of the above thematic topics exhibit notably heterogeneous patterns in spatial distribution. The topic compositions in terms of land use pattern and mobility pattern at the station level reveal the current performance of station areas. Plus, results from the regression analysis confirm that most of the land use patterns that are related to various mixed use have close relationships with mobility patterns of bicycle-metro integration. Yet it is noteworthy that the effects of land use patterns often differ and change over time, namely affecting different mobility patterns. This study gives rise to alternative insights into the synergy between bike sharing and metro, which may help policymakers to develop more targeted TOD strategies. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Bike-sharing offers a convenient feeder mode for connecting to public transport, which helps to address the last-mile problem. However, few studies have examined the nuanced relationship between the built environment and the integration of free-floating bike-sharing (FFBS) with urban rail transport (URT). Drawing on weekly records of 3.12 million trips of the FFBS system in Nanjing, China, we examined the nonlinear effects of the built environment on FFBS-URT integrated use. A quantile regression method is utilised to estimate the relationships for morning and evening peaks, respectively. The results demonstrate the existence of the nonlinearity of the relationships. The effects of the built environment show variations in the significance levels and magnitudes of coefficients, depending on the quantiles. For example, the length of minor roads in station areas is strongly related to the integrated use at low quantile stations, whereas this effect is not statistically significant at medium and high quantiles. We also find that bicycle infrastructure displays more salient nonlinear effects than land-use variables and external transport facilities. In addition, temporal differences in the relationships between the built environment and the integrated use are also unveiled. Our findings help to inform dedicated and effective built environment interventions which support the planning of seamless connections between bike-sharing and urban rail transport. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {To evaluate the dynamic effects of the dockless bike-sharing scheme on the demand of the London Cycle Hire (LCH) scheme at the station level, a novel bicycle demand prediction model is proposed using the deep learning approach, based on the transaction records at 645 docking stations of LCH in the period between July 2017 and March 2018. First, an intervention response module (IRM) is established to model the time-series trends of bicycle demands at individual LCH docking stations, with and without the dockless bike-sharing scheme. Then, the Graph Neural Networks (GNN) predictors are adopted to predict the demand for LCH, incorporating the learned effects from IRM. Results indicate that the proposed bicycle demand prediction model can achieve promising prediction performances, with higher R-squared (R2), lower Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) and lower Mean Absolute Errors (MAE), compared to conventional prediction models. More importantly, the proposed model can recognize the dynamic effects of the dockless bike-sharing scheme on the demand for LCH. For instance, there are possible spillover effects for the influence area of dockless bike-sharing scheme, especially for the neighboring areas that have well-integrated bicycle facilities (e.g., cycle lanes). In addition, the effect of dockless bike sharing on the demand for LCH can magnify over time. Moreover, influences on the demands on weekends are more remarkable than that on weekdays. Findings should improve the understanding on the interdependency between the demands of dockless and docked bike-sharing systems. This should shed light to the optimal management strategy for the docked bike-sharing system that can maximize the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.  Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.}

Because of its simple form, each rule is easy to understand, as is its influence on individual predictions, selected subsets of predictions, or globally over the entire space of joint input variable values. Similarly, the degree of relevance of the respective input variables can be assessed globally, locally in different regions of the input space, or at individual prediction points. Techniques are presented for automatically identifying those variables that are involved in interactions with other variables, the strength and degree of those interactions, as well as the identities of the other variables with which they interact. Graphical representations are used to visualize both main and interaction effects.},

First, it does  not scale well in cases where the input has high  dimensionality, and, second, it is vulnerable to  out-of-distribution (OOD) sampling when the training  set is relatively small. In this paper, we propose a  novel ALE approximation, called Differential  Accumulated Local Effects (DALE), which can be used  in cases where the ML model is differentiable and an  auto-differentiable framework is accessible. Our  proposal has significant computational advantages,  making feature effect estimation applicable to  high-dimensional Machine Learning scenarios with  near-zero computational overhead. Furthermore, DALE  does not create artificial points for calculating  the feature effect, resolving misleading estimations  due to OOD sampling. Finally, we formally prove  that, under some hypotheses, DALE is an unbiased  estimator of ALE and we present a method for  quantifying the standard error of the  explanation.

However, it has two limitations. First, it does not quantify the deviation of instance-level (local) effects from the average (global) effect, known as heterogeneity. Second, for estimating the average effect, it partitions the feature domain into user-defined, fixed-sized bins, where different bin sizes may lead to inconsistent ALE estimations. To address these limitations, we propose Robust and Heterogeneity-aware ALE (RHALE). RHALE quantifies the heterogeneity by considering the standard deviation of the local effects and automatically determines an optimal variable-size bin-splitting. In this paper, we prove that to achieve an unbiased approximation of the standard deviation of local effects within each bin, bin splitting must follow a set of sufficient conditions. Based on these conditions, we propose an algorithm that automatically determines the optimal partitioning, balancing the estimation bias and variance. Through evaluations on synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of RHALE compared to other methods, including the advantages of automatic bin splitting, especially in cases with correlated features.},

However, the usage of this transport mode remains low in China, raising several concerns. The development of the bike-sharing behaviour can help to achieve sustainable development goals. Thus, this study aims to explore the impact of price, traffic congestion, and supply chain on bike-sharing selection behaviour. We employ big data technology to accurately research and evaluate usage behaviour towards bike-sharing apps in Beijing over a 4-day period. First, we administer a preliminary questionnaire survey across the country to explore factors influencing the choice of bike-sharing. Second, we perform a panel model regression to analyse the degree of impact by major factors on bike-sharing usage. The results revealed that price, traffic congestion, and supply chain affect the choice of bike-sharing and the degree of each factor's impact differs by time of day. Drawing on these findings, we offer the following suggestions to increase the usage amount of bike-sharing and improve the operating efficiency of bike-sharing companies: (1) design time-based charging strategies (2) reasonably limit the number of shared bikes as per time of day (3) establish effective layouts for bicycle sites (4) account for maintenance time, and (5) use methods other than price wars to increase usage. {\copyright} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Standard effect size measures based on differences, such as the commonly used Cohen's, fail to capture the treatment-related effects on the data if the effects were not reflected by the central tendency. The present work aims at (i) developing a non-parametric alternative to Cohen's d, which (ii) circumvents some of its numerical limitations and (iii) involves obvious changes in the data that do not affect the group means and are therefore not captured by Cohen's d. Results We propose "Impact'' as a novel non-parametric measure of effect size obtained as the sum of two separate components and includes (i) a difference-based effect size measure implemented as the change in the central tendency of the group-specific data normalized to pooled variability and (ii) a data distribution shape-based effect size measure implemented as the difference in probability density of the group-specific data. Results obtained on artificial and empirical data showed that ``Impact''is superior to Cohen's d by its additional second component in detecting clearly visible effects not reflected in central tendencies. The proposed effect size measure is invariant to the scaling of the data, reflects changes in the central tendency in cases where differences in the shape of probability distributions between subgroups are negligible, but captures changes in probability distributions as effects and is numerically stable even if the variances of the data set or its subgroups disappear. Conclusions The proposed effect size measure shares the ability to observe such an effect with machine learning algorithms. Therefore, the proposed effect size measure is particularly well suited for data science and artificial intelligence-based knowledge discovery from big and heterogeneous data.},

Effect sizes are an important complement to null hypothesis significance testing by providing a practical significance measure that is independent of sample size considerations.

  abstract = {Machine learning has great potential for improving products, processes and research. But computers usually do not explain their predictions which is a barrier to the adoption of machine learning. This book is about making machine learning models and their decisions interpretable. After exploring the concepts of interpretability, you will learn about simple, interpretable models such as decision trees, decision rules and linear regression. The focus of the book is on model-agnostic methods for interpreting black box models such as feature importance and accumulated local effects, and explaining individual predictions with Shapley values and LIME. In addition, the book presents methods specific to deep neural networks. All interpretation methods are explained in depth and discussed critically. How do they work under the hood? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How can their outputs be interpreted? This book will enable you to select and correctly apply the interpretation method that is most suitable for your machine learning project. Reading the book is recommended for machine learning practitioners, data scientists, statisticians, and anyone else interested in making machine learning models interpretable.},

ALE has two primary advantages over other approaches like partial dependency plots (PDP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP): its values are not affected by the presence of interactions among variables in a model and its computation is relatively rapid. This package rewrites the original code from the 'ALEPlot' package for calculating ALE data and it completely reimplements the plotting of ALE values. Future versions hope to extend the original ALE concept beyond global explanations with ALE-based measures that can be used for statistical inference as well as an ALE-based approach for local explanations.},

There are at least three challenges with conducting statistical inference based on ALE: ensuring the reliability of ALE analyses, especially in the context of small datasets; intuitively characterizing a variable's overall effect in ML; and making robust inferences from ML data analysis. In response, we introduce innovative tools and techniques for statistical inference using ALE, establishing bootstrapped confidence intervals tailored to dataset size and introducing ALE effect size measures that intuitively indicate effects on both the outcome variable scale and a normalized scale. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use these tools to draw reliable statistical inferences, reflecting the flexible patterns ALE adeptly highlights, with implementations available in the 'ale' package in R. This work propels the discourse on ALE and its applicability in ML and statistical analysis forward, offering practical solutions to prevailing challenges in the field.},

  abstract = {A characteristic of most real world problems is that collecting unlabelled examples is easier and cheaper than collecting labelled ones. As a result, learning from partially labelled data is a crucial and demanding area of machine learning, and extending techniques from fully to partially supervised scenarios is a challenging problem. Our work focuses on two types of partially labelled data that can occur in binary problems: semi-supervised data, where the labelled set contains both positive and negative examples, and positive-unlabelled data, a more restricted version of partial supervision where the labelled set consists of only positive examples. In both settings, it is very important to explore a large number of features in order to derive useful and interpretable information about our classification task, and select a subset of features that contains most of the useful information. In this thesis, we address three fundamental and tightly coupled questions concerning feature selection in partially labelled data; all three relate to the highly controversial issue of when does additional unlabelled data improve performance in partially labelled learning environments and when does not. The first question is what are the properties of statistical hypothesis testing in such data? Second, given the widespread criticism of significance testing, what can we do in terms of effect size estimation, that is, quantification of how strong the dependency between feature X and the partially observed label Y? Finally, in the context of feature selection, how well can features be ranked by estimated measures, when the population values are unknown? The answers to these questions provide a comprehensive picture of feature selection in partially labelled data. Interesting applications include for estimation of mutual information quantities, structure learning in Bayesian networks, and investigation of how human-provided prior knowledge can overcome the restrictions of partial labelling. One direct contribution of our work is to enable valid statistical hypothesis testing and estimation in positive-unlabelled data. Focusing on a generalised likelihood ratio test and on estimating mutual information, we provide five key contributions. (1) We prove that assuming all unlabelled examples are negative cases is sufficient for independence testing, but not for power analysis activities. (2) We suggest a new methodology that compensates this and enables power analysis, allowing sample size determination for observing an effect with a desired power by incorporating user's prior knowledge over the prevalence of positive examples. (3) We show a new capability, supervision determination, which can determine a-priori the number of labelled examples the user must collect before being able to observe a desired statistical effect. (4) We derive an estimator of the mutual information in positive-unlabelled data, and its asymptotic distribution. (5) Finally, we show how to rank features with and without prior knowledge. Also we derive extensions of these results to semi-supervised data. In another extension, we investigate how we can use our results for Markov blanket discovery in partially labelled data. While there are many different algorithms for deriving the Markov blanket of fully supervised nodes, the partially labelled problem is far more challenging, and there is a lack of principled approaches in the literature. Our work constitutes a generalization of the conditional tests of independence for partially labelled binary target variables, which can handle the two main partially labelled scenarios: positive-unlabelled and semi-supervised. The result is a significantly deeper understanding of how to control false negative errors in Markov Blanket discovery procedures and how unlabelled data can help. Finally, we present how our results can be used for information theoretic feature selection in partially labelled data. Our work extends naturally feature selection criteria suggested for fully-supervised data, to partially labelled scenarios. These criteria can capture both the relevancy and redundancy of the features and can be used for semi-supervised and positive-unlabelled data.},

  abstract = {Mitigating global warming problems initially involves reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, therefore the uncertainty of GHG emission estimates needs to be assessed concisely. Although the uncertainty of GHG emission estimates is generally evaluated using classical confidence interval, quantifying the uncertainty based on non-normal GHG emission estimates or small dataset may lead to a significant bias. Using bootstrap confidence intervals is an effective means of reducing such a bias. This study presents a procedure for constructing four bootstrap confidence intervals to assess the uncertainty of GHG emission estimates for three non-normal distributions (namely, Weibull, Gamma and Beta). These bootstrap confidence intervals are  standard bootstrap (SB) con{\"i}{\textlnot}dence interval, percentile bootstrap (PB) con{\"i}{\textlnot}dence interval, Bias-corrected percentiles bootstrap (BCPB) con{\"i}{\textlnot}dence interval and bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) con{\"i}{\textlnot}dence interval. The sensitivity of bootstrap intervals for emission data is examined under various combinations of sample size and parameters of underlying non-normal distributions using three indices: coverage performance, interval mean, and interval standard deviation. Simulation results indicate that the bootstrap confidence intervals for assessing the uncertainty of emission estimates are highly applicable with small sample size and the data distribution is non-normal. Compared with the classical confidence interval, bootstrap confidence intervals have smaller interval mean and smaller interval standard deviation for small sample size under non-normal distributions. This study recommends BCa confidence interval to assess the uncertainty of the emission estimates as long as sample size is 15 or more and the distribution is non-normal. A case study with emission data of the High-Bleed Pneumatic controllers demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.},

  abstract = {Modelling the effect of a covariate vector on the distribution of a response variable, requires some structural assumptions, if the curse of dimensionality is to be avoided. Generalized additive models (GAMs) assume that the effects of the covariates are additive, with no, or only low order, interactions between effects. The additive assumption ensures scalability in the number of covariates and facilitates computational efficiency during model fitting. It also enhances model interpretability, which is critically important during model building and checking, as well as for communicating modelling results. This chapter formally introduces standard GAMs, as well as more flexibile GAMs for location shape and scale (GAMLSS). Is also shows how to interactively build and improve GAM and GAMLSS models via the mgcv and mgcViz R packages, which exploit their modular and interpretable structure. The final part of the chapter shows how to exploit the additive structure of GAMs to build powerful predictive models, by using random forests and online aggregation methods.},
